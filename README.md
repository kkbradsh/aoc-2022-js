# AdventOfCode 2022 - Javascript

## Description

Of the good, the bad, and the ugly, this is the ugly ... I mean it works, so it can't be all bad ... lol. This is the code that I wrote for [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). 

## Running the code

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- Run with one of the following:
  - To run a single day and part with test or final input: `npm run start [day] [part] [file]`
    - day: 1 through 25
    - part: 1 or 2
    - t for test or f for final
    - example: npm run start 1 1 t
  - To run part 1 and part 2 for days with final input: `npm run start`
